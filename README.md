# Automation-for-Vivado
```python
models = os.listdir("C:/Users/Siddhesh/Downloads/Modules") #modules list as array 
print(models)
```
Providing path to this part would run the top modules included in the Modules directory. This will ultimately automate the process for synthesis. Prior to this, add the path to Vivado as an environment variable and also install the required directories.
